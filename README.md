Potato Leaf Disease Classification Using Deep Learning
OVERVIEW:-
Potatoes are a crucial staple crop worldwide, contributing significantly to global food security and agricultural economies. However, potato cultivation is threatened by various diseases that can significantly reduce yield and quality. Identifying and classifying these diseases promptly is essential for effective management and mitigation.

Traditionally, diagnosing plant diseases relies on visual inspection by experts, which can be time-consuming and prone to error. Recent advancements in deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), offer a promising solution to this challenge. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it is possible to automate and enhance the accuracy of disease classification from images of potato leaves.

Deep learning, particularly using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has revolutionized image analysis tasks, including disease classification. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for tasks like identifying patterns in leaf images that correspond to different diseases.
